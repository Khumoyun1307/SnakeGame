# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We want this project to be a welcoming, harassment‑free experience for everyone who participates.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

- Being respectful and considerate in language and tone
- Welcoming constructive feedback and differing viewpoints
- Focusing on what’s best for the project and community

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

- Harassment, discrimination, or personal attacks
- Trolling, deliberate disruption, or “dogpiling”
- Publishing someone else’s private information without permission

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies in all project spaces (issues, pull requests, discussions, and other community channels).

## Enforcement

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying standards and taking appropriate action in response to unacceptable behavior.

If you experience or witness a Code of Conduct violation:

- Prefer a private report when possible (for example, via GitHub’s private reporting features if enabled for the repository).
- If private reporting is not available, open an issue with minimal details and request a private channel for follow‑up.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is inspired by the Contributor Covenant, version 2.1.
